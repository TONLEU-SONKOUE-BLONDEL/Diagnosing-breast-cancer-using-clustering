# Diagnosing-breast-cancer-using-clustering
Let us assume that the Wisconsin hospital wants to develop a decision support system to help the diagnosis of breast cancer. To understand the patterns that can exist in breast mass is a primary objective.
This project will use the CRISP-DM methodology. The data used for this study can be obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. It is the Wisconsin breast cancer data set.
